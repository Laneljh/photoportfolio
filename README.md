# photoportfolio
Simple photography portfolio web dev exercise project.

There isn't much to this, actually. I did this as a warm-up/exercise after coming back from a vacation where I had NO access to a computer to work on my code. I liked how it came out, made some minor tweaks(and will likely make more) and figured it would make a nice addition to my portfolio until I finish my more complex projects. 

All the images are being sourced from unsplash.com, which is a great resource that I highly recommend.
